# Hinged Printed Tophat, Camlock compatible
A collection of hinged printed Tophat parts compatible with the V0.2 camlocks.

Remixed from [MSiemons TopHatHinge Mod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/MSiemons/TophatHingeV0.1).

## Camlock-Feature
The only parts that changed for the camlocks to work are the front bottom corner pieces of the tophat. So if you already have a tophat you want to continue to use you just need to print one of each Lower_Corner... parts. Then you'll only need to screw in a M3x6 or M3x8 BHCS into the bottom hole of the printed part, replace the old stock corners on your tophat and adjust the screw until the camlock engages properly.

## Panel Options
All the Parts that clamp on the panels are provided for different panel thicknesses, so choose according to your panel thickness. Additionally for the lower corner pieces there are variant with more contact area to the panel, as I had issues with the panels sometimes popping out with the stock parts.
